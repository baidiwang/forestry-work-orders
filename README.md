Why do NYC boroughs have different tree numbers?
As I’m also working on a project about NYC trees for interactive craft class, I did some research about trees in the city. What I found interesting is the difference between trees that per person has in NYC five boroughs. Depending on data provided from the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, Queens is the borough with the most trees. I want to find the reasons that caused the difference of trees in five boroughs. I assume the potential reasons might be related to median incomes and available spaces. So I also collected data about median income and parks numbers in five boroughs.

Data links:

    Trees numbers in five boroughs
    Population of five boroughs
    Median Household income of five boroughs\
    Parks lists of five boroughs

Potential human sources:

    Trees expert: An arborist, Samuel A. Bishop II, as I'm also doing a biography research assignment about him, so I could reach out to him to get professional knowledge of trees.
    Here's the list of official people I could contact with: New York City Department of Parks & Recreation

Example(s) of a publication:

    This is a super cool map done by MIT. It is very visual that it shows the areas covered by trees on a map while having a percentage showing the tress coverage rate. I’m thinking of making a map too, but I will focus on the reasons that caused the difference of trees areas in five boroughs. This is the link
